    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
    <p>My name is Dustin and this is my portfolio. This portfolio was created for my CSC 106 class to show all the work I complete in class. This class is an inrtoduction to programing where we will be learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to program websites, programs and apps. This webpage will also serve as a valuable learning experience in web building and web design in addition to being a functional portfolio. Content included in this portfolio will include Javascript files, apps and other programs that I have created both in and out of class.<p>
